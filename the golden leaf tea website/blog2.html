      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">One of my closest tea friends, Connie of Tea in Spoons, is celebrating a birthday this month.</p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">She wanted to create something fun for her tea blog and asked me to join her. After a few brainstorming sessions, we decided to make tea infused jam because Connie is a big lover of jam.</p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">By now, you probably know that Iâ€™m obsessed with scones and jam is one of its best accompaniments. </p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">  We both enjoy our black teas in the morning so we decided to play around with a breakfast tea for this jam recipe. </p>
