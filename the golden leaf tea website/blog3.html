      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;"> Breakfast teas are my most consumed teas. Therefore, Iâ€™ve tried a lot of different breakfast teas brands over the years</p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;"> Although Irish Breakfast tea is my favourite of the 3 main breakfast teas, English Breakfast tea is most common. </p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;"> It is more mild compared to Irish Breakfast and Scottish Breakfast tea. However, not all English Breakfast teas are alike.</p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">  In fact, they can vary quite a bit depending on the brand. But, when I think of a breakfast tea I think of something that is strong, full-bodied and takes well to milk if desired.</p>
