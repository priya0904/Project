      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">As a busy full-time teacher, Tracy Truong uses art therapy to help her find moments of peace during her limited free time. </p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">She started practicing and sharing her watercolour regularly with her Traces of Water Instagram community. Delicate florals and pastel colour palettes fill her feed that she refers to as her “tea garden”. </p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">A quick look at her work will show you that she not only incorporates vintage teacups into the photographs of her watercolour, but she also recreates the patterns and shapes from the teacups on paper. </p>
      <p style=" color: palegreen; font-size: 30px;">  At the Tea Table Tracy shared her daily tea rituals, favourite teacup inspired artwork, and she recalled a special moment that sparked her tea journey.</p>
